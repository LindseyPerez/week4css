            <h2>Lisbon</h2>
            <p>My favorite city to visit is in Portugal. Lisbon hold a unique charm that <br>
                captivates visitors from around te world. Its picturesque streets adorned <br>
                with colorful tiles, intricate cobblestone pavements, and historic architecture <br>
                narrate tales of centuries past. Bathed in abundant sunlight, Lisbon offers a <br>
                Mediterranean climate that beckons travelers to explore its vibrant neighborhoods <br>
                and scenic viewpoints. The city's rich cultural tapestry, influenced by a blend <br>
                of Moorish, Roman, and Portuguese heritage, manifests in its lively Fado music, <br>
                delectable cuisine, and warm hospitality. With its fusion of tradition and modernity, <br>
                Lisbon stands as a testament to Portugal's enduring allure and remains a cherished <br>
                destination for adventurers seeking unforgettable experiences.<br>
